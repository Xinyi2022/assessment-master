        <h2>Practice</h2>
        <p>Tuesdays and Thursdays @ 5pm. FIRST PRACTICE THIS THURSDAY AT 5PM. Possibility of Mondays at 4:30pm as an
          alternate day
          if that is better for families' schedules. Please let me know of any preferences.</p>

        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>Smith is working with SF house to arrange games. It may be sporadic in the beginning as they are looking for
          a coach,
          but we should be able to have scrimmages and games with the other teams that have coaches. We will eventually
          look to
          have games weekly, preferably Saturdays.</p>

        <h2>Tournaments</h2>
        <p>We are looking to play in 1-2 tournaments before the summer. We will gauge readiness and family schedules,
          but looking
          at the end of April (Spring Championship) and mid-May (Spring Finale). These dates are definitely not set,
          not-mandatory, but we view them as a great way to expose our kids to different levels of the sport from
          different
          cities/regions.</p>

      <h1>Cost</h1>
      <p>We are asking families for <span style="color: orange;">$200/mo through May</span>, and possibly for the first
        part of June, solely to cover coach
        expenses,
        uniforms and gear (we plan to have some cool jerseys, warmups, and gear), and program costs.</p>

      <p><span style="color: orange;">Costs for Tournaments are extra but are typically around $350 per team for
          registration.</span> If there is any
        shortfall, I've
        committed to covering those costs.</p>

      <h1>Seasons & Locations</h1>
