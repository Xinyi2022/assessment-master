                <p>Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you play in games. Remember how much fun you
                    had
                    growing up when
                    you used to just go outside and play with your friends? We advocate using the "compete to learn"
                    approach to
                    practice--it lets kids play and have fun while competing. This type of practice, using competitive
                    drills,
                    does a better
                    job of preparing players to compete in real games. Technically, this is called transference. What
                    you do
                    in
                    practice
                    carries over into what you do in games.</p>

            <div class="description">
                <p>Want to improve your team's ball handling? Games like dribble knockout are very popular. Every player
                    must have his or
                    her own basketball. Coach starts the game. Every player must dribble constantly, stay in-bounds and
                    try
                    to knock the
                    ball away from all other players in the game. Lose control of your basketball or go out-of-bounds,
                    and
                    you're
                    eliminated. Boundaries for 10-12 players could start as half the court. After several players are
                    eliminated, the
                    boundary is reduced to only inside the 3-point area. Boundary is reduced again to the free-throw
                    lane.
                    Finally, when
                    there are just two players left, they play the "finals" in the free throw half circle.</p>
